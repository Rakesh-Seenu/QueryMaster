      "explanation": "The answer is relevant to the question as it provides a list of career paths mentioned in the context. It is faithful to the context as it only mentions career paths that are actually present in the text. However, it may not be comprehensive as the question asks for 'carrier ways' which could be interpreted as methods or paths for deployment, but the answer assumes it to be career paths. The context does mention 'deployment' but it seems to be related to a computing setup rather than career development.",
